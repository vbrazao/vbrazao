## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vasco, an applied statistician based in Lisbon. My academic background is in Psychology, and for the past 5+ years I've focused on developing my statistical programming and analysis skills as well as taken a special interest in open science. I sometimes blog about topics I'm interested, including stats, [here](https://vbrazao.github.io/blog/). To check out some of my academic publications, click through to my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0009-0009-2206-202X). To hire me through Upwork, check out [my Upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010ee2f24d43313103). If you must find me on LinkedIn, I trust you'll manage on your own.

I love learning. Lately I've been working through:
- Bruno Rodrigues's [Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R](https://raps-with-r.dev/), to improve my reproducibility toolkit and keep growing as an open scientist.
- Emil Hvitfeldt and Julia Silge's [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/), to get comfortable building a text classification model for a client.
